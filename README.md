# vim.xlam

Vim experience in Excel. This is an Excel add-in that allows you to use Vim keybindings within Excel.

## Description

vim.xlam is an Excel add-in designed to provide a Vim-like experience, allowing you to navigate and operate within Excel using keyboard shortcuts.

Designed with extensibility in mind, you can create your own methods and easily customize keybindings using the `Map` method. It's also designed to allow you to change keybindings easily from the default ones, so you can configure it to suit your preferences.

***Demo:***

\* The default keymaps are defined with `Map` method in [DefaultConfig.bas](./src/DefaultConfig.bas).

### Custom Key Mapping

- `<C-[>` → `<Esc>`

## Customization

By placing the [configuration file](./config/_vimxlamrc) in the directory where vim.xlam is saved, you can load the settings at startup. The file must be named `_vimxlamrc`. Please save the file with cp932 encoding.

### Syntax

- Lines starting with `#` or blank lines are ignored.
- Lines starting with `set` allow you to modify defined configuration values.
- Lines containing `map` or `unmap` allow you to modify key mappings.

### Options

You can configure using the same syntax as Vim's `set`. For configuration examples, refer to the [configuration file](./config/_vimxlamrc).

| Option Key | Type | Description | Default |
| ---------- | ---- | ----------- | ------- |
| `statusprefix` | string | Prefix for temporary messages displayed in the status bar | `vim.xlam: ` |
| `togglekey` | string | Key to toggle Vim mode on/off (Vim-style key specification) | `<C-m>` |
| `scrolloff` | float | Up and down offset for `ScrollCurrentXXX` series (px) | `54.0` |
| `jumplisthistory` | int | Maximum number of items to keep in the jump list | `100` |
| `[no]japanese` | bool | Japanese mode / English mode | `True` |
| `[no]jiskeyboard` | bool | JIS keyboard / US keyboard | `True` |
| `colorpickersize` | float | ColorPicker form size (px) | `12.0` |
| `customcolor1` | string | Custom color #1 in ColorPicker | `#ff6600` ![#ff6600](https://via.placeholder.com/15/ff6600/000000?text=+) |
| `customcolor2` | string | Custom color #2 in ColorPicker | `#ff9966` ![#ff9966](https://via.placeholder.com/15/ff9966/000000?text=+) |
| `customcolor3` | string | Custom color #3 in ColorPicker | `#ff00ff` ![#ff00ff](https://via.placeholder.com/15/ff00ff/000000?text=+) |
| `customcolor4` | string | Custom color #4 in ColorPicker | `#008000` ![#008000](https://via.placeholder.com/15/008000/000000?text=+) |
| `customcolor5` | string | Custom color #5 in ColorPicker | `#0000ff` ![#0000ff](https://via.placeholder.com/15/0000ff/000000?text=+) |
| `[no]debug` | bool | Enable / disable debug mode | `False` |

### Keymap

You can add/change/remove key mappings.

- `{lhs}` specifies the key mapping in the original Vim style.
  - If `<cmd>` is specified, it is treated as a command mode specification and processed as a simple string.
- `{rhs}` specifies the function name you want to execute.
  - If `<key>` is specified, another key is specified similar to `{lhs}` in Vim key mapping.

There are currently four modes.

- `n` (Normal): Normal mode. Basically, always map in mode.
- `v` (Visual): Visual mode. Specify keys to return to Normal mode, etc.
- `c` (Cmdline): Command-line mode. Effective in command-line mode with characters such as `:` or `/`.
- `i` (Shape_Insert): Shape Insert mode. Effective when pressing `i`/`a`, etc., during shape selection.

**Syntax for `map` and `unmap`**

```
[n|v|c|i]map [<cmd>]{lhs} [<key>]{rhs} [arg1] [arg2] [...]
 ^^^^^^^      ^^^^^ ^^^^^  ^^^^^ ^^^^^  ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
   |            |     |      |     |     `- args: Arguments of the function specified by {rhs}
   |            |     |      |     `------- rhs : Function name to be execute
   |            |     |      `------------- key : Flag to simulate keys with {rhs}
   |            |     `-------------------- lhs : Key sequence (vim style)
   |            `-------------------------- cmd : Flag to enable in command mode (plain text)
   `--------------------------------------- mode: Specify pre-defined mode ("n" if omitted)

[n|v|c|i]unmap [<cmd>]{lhs}
         ^^^^^
          `--- disable mapping
```

\* It follows the same syntax as that specified in [DefaultConfig.bas](./src/DefaultConfig.bas), so refer to it as needed.
